Publicizing because that's what the cool kids seem to do to get into grad school other than just having better grades than me.

Some messing around trying to build a suspension kinematics solver (for Baja SAE, but like, it's pretty general). Very incomplete, the basics are definitely there. This is a snapshot from a while ago, there's a good amount of progress since here but the data from that is actually in our current car so not releasing. If this commit is over 2 years old and you're really bored, email me for the cool version.
